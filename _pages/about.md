I am Hokeun Cha, a prospective Ph.D. stduent in Computer Sciences at University of Wisconsin-Madison (starting from Spring semester 2021). I am currently working as a researcher in Data-Intensive Computing Laboratory (DICL) at Sungkyunkwan University. I received my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University under the supervision of Professor Beomseok Nam in 2020, and bachelor's degrees in Computer Engineering and Business Administration at Sungkyunkwan University in 2018. For details, please refer to my [CV](https://github.com/chahk0129/chahk0129.github.io/files/CV_HokeunCha.pdf).


Research Interests
------
My research interests include data-intensive systems, storage systems, database systems, and distributed systems. In particular, I am highly interested in designing and implementing system software for new hardware such as Non-Volatile Memory (NVM). I am also passionate about projects that accelerate overall performance of systems by combining state-of-the-art technologies such as Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA).
