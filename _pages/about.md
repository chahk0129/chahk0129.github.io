I am Hokeun Cha, a first-year Ph.D stduent in the Department of Computer Science at University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
I am currently working with [Prof. Xiangyao Yu](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yxy/). 
Before joining UW-Madison, I worked as a researcher at Sungkyunkwan University. 
I received my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering under the supervision of [Prof. Beomseok Nam](http://dicl.skku.edu/~bnam/) in 2020, 
and bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Engineering, and Business Administration in 2018, all at Sungkyunkwan University. For details, please refer to my [CV](https://chahk0129.github.io/files/cv.pdf).
